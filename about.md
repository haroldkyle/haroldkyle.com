![Abbot Pass]({{ site.assets }}images/medium/2014-10-06-abbot-pass.jpg)

I am a native Marylander who lives in Syracuse after seven formative years in Minnesota. I love hiking, coding, and cast iron. During the day I run [Boxcar Press](https://www.boxcarpress.com/) and its related enterprises, [Smock](https://smockpaper.com) and [Bella Figura](https://www.bellafigura.com/). Check out my wife's take over at [Debbie Urbanski](http://debbieurbanski.com).
