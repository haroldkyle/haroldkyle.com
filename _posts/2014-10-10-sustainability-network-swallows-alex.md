I've been very pleased at the built-in "Alex" voice on my iPad, enough to have him/her dictate my reading assignments within the Voice Dream app. It's pretty great--I can get homework done while cleaning the kitchen etc. 

Last night poor Alex got into a loop when he/she fell into the vortex of Walmart's Sustainability Network, a diagram in one of the assigned readings. Undoubtedly Alex is not the first to have done so...

(In case you're wondering, Alex did eventually recover, a little dizzy, to finish the assignment.)
