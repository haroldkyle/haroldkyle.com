So my big news is that I'm starting an MBA program this month, at [MIT Sloan](http://mitsloan.mit.edu/). Realizing that I'll need to take a lot of notes in the upcoming months, I hunkered down this last weekend to figure out how to stay organized.

I knew that I wanted to write notes in [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) with [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) (my usual method) but wasn't sure how to organize these text files. Well, it dawned on me last night, [Github](https://github.com/) of course. Once I figured this much out, it was probably inevitable that I would start running [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to host the notes online. Man, this feels refreshing. After orchestrating the bloated rock opera of WordPress at work all day long, I can come home to the punk rock of Jekyll. 

So with Github in the mix, I also had the crazy idea to post my class notes in a public repository. I'm honestly not sure if I will be able to take notes in a "public" manner--or in a way that others will understand--but I figure I'll give it a shot. It makes me wonder if during the 20 month program anyone will fork my notes and submit a pull request. If that's going to happen anywhere, I suppose it will happen at MIT.

I'm off to fire up 13 Songs and spend a few minutes getting my class notes looking nice. I'm thinking [EB Garamond](https://github.com/georgd/EB-Garamond) in the spirit of the evening...
